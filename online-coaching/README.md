## About

C150 Online Coaching is a project built for the Columbia Lightweight Rowing Team, with the goals of incorporating data into the selection and development of rowers. Coaches didn't previously have any way of viewing detailed physiological metrics offered by RP3 rowing without rowers directly emailing all workout data reports. This app focuses on offering a personalized view of each athlete to coaches, showing them race results, RP3 test results, and physiological stress scores. 

Access of rower data is restricted to the coaches of C150.
